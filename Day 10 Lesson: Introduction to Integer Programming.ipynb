    "## Day 10: Introduction to Integer Programming\n",
    "Integer programming is a branch of optimization where some or all decision variables are required to take integer values. This is particularly useful when your decisions are inherently discrete—such as the number of products to produce, items to schedule, or units to allocate. In today’s lesson, we’ll use PuLP to solve an integer programming problem.\n",

    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "A company produces two products:\n",
    "\n",
    "Product A with a profit of $10 per unit\n",
    "\n",
    "Product B with a profit of $8 per unit\n",
    "\n",
    "The production is subject to:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Resource Constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit of Product A requires 3 units of raw material, and each unit of Product B requires 2 units of raw material.\n",
    "\n",
    "Total raw material available is 30 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contract Requirement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The company must produce at least 2 units of Product A.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nonnegativity and Integrality:\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of units produced for both products must be nonnegative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The goal is to maximize profit:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximize P=10x+8y,\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to:\n",
    "\n",
    "3x+2y≤30,x≥2,x≥0,y≥0,x,y∈Z."
