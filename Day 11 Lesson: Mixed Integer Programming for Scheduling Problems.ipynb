    "### Day 11: Balanced Job Scheduling with Makespan Minimization\n",
    "In this lesson, we address a scheduling problem where a facility must process a fixed, balanced number of jobs of three types (A, B, and C) using two machines. Each job requires a specific amount of processing time, and the goal is to assign the jobs to the two machines so that the overall completion time (the makespan) is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description  \n",
    "There are 2 machines.  \n",
    "There are 3 job types: A, B, and C.  \n",
    "The facility must process exactly 6 jobs of each type (a balanced production of 6 of A, 6 of B, and 6 of C).  \n",
    "#### Processing times for each job:  \n",
    "Type A: 1 time unit per job.  \n",
    "Type B: 1 time unit per job.  \n",
    "Type C: 2 time units per job.  \n",
    "#### Decision variables:  \n",
    "x_A1, x_A2: Number of type A jobs processed on Machine 1 and Machine 2, respectively.  \n",
    "x_B1, x_B2: Number of type B jobs processed on Machine 1 and Machine 2, respectively.  \n",
    "x_C1, x_C2: Number of type C jobs processed on Machine 1 and Machine 2, respectively.  \n",
    "#### Balance (demand) constraints:  \n",
    "x_A1 + x_A2 = 6  \n",
    "x_B1 + x_B2 = 6  \n",
    "x_C1 + x_C2 = 6  \n",
    "#### Machine processing time:  \n",
    "Machine 1 total time, T1 = (1 * x_A1) + (1 * x_B1) + (2 * x_C1)  \n",
    "Machine 2 total time, T2 = (1 * x_A2) + (1 * x_B2) + (2 * x_C2)  \n",
    "#### Makespan:  \n",
    "Introduce a variable C_max that must be at least as high as the total processing time on each machine:  \n",
    "C_max >= T1  \n",
    "C_max >= T2  \n",
    "#### Objective:  \n",
    "Minimize C_max (i.e. finish all jobs as early as possible).  \n"
