    "### Day 11: Balanced Job Scheduling on 2 Machines Using Mixed Integer Programming  \n",
    "In this lesson, we consider a scheduling problem with two machines. There are two types of jobs (A and B), and each job requires 1 unit of processing time. Each machine has a time limit (for example, 8 time units). We want to maximize the total number of jobs processed (across both machines) subject to two key conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The processing time on each machine cannot exceed the time limit.  \n",
    "The number of type A jobs processed must equal the number of type B jobs processed (i.e., the production must be balanced).\n"
